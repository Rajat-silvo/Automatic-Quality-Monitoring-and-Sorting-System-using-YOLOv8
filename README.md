# Automatic-Tomato-Quality-Monitoring-and-Sorting-System-using-YOLOv8

•	Built a YOLOv8-based computer vision system to classify tomatoes by ripeness (color) and estimate size using bounding box measurements from OpenCV.
•	Converted pixel measurements to real-world dimensions using calibration for accurate size categorization (Small, Medium, Large).
•	Designed an Arduino-controlled mechanical sorter with servo motors to physically separate tomatoes based on classification results.
•	Established serial communication between the Python-based detection system and Arduino hardware for real-time sorting automation.
